<body>
    <p>The website shows how I can use php, html, and javascript interchangeably.</p>
    <p>These are the things that I will show:
        <ul>The use of hebCal a javascript NPM that I downloaded and I will use the libraries</ul>
        <ul>The ability for the user to register, login, and add to my database</ul>
        <ul>The database is phpmyadmin where I can see modifications via html as well as within the phpmyadmin GUI</ul>
        <ul>I can also showcase my knowledge of css by the lovely sidebars you see on the right.</ul>
