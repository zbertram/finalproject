Classic Potato Latkes
By Melissa Clark
This recipe is for a classic, unadorned latke; no kohlrabi or cumin here. Serve them hot and make more than you think
you need. They go fast.
Step 1
Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes
and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and
wring out as much of the liquid as possible.
Step 2
Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs,
flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is
absorbed.
Step 3
In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in
about 1/4 inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in
the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into
the hot pan, cooking in batches. Use a spatula to flatten and shape the
drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy,
about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned,
about another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined
plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter
